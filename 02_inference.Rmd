This chapter introduces the statistical concepts necessary to understand p-values and confidence intervals. These terms are ubiquitous in the life science literature. Let's use [this paper](http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/53/suppl_3/S215.full) as an example. 
```

&emsp;&emsp;这一章主要介绍基本的统计概念，这些统计概念是我们理解P值和置信区间的前提。这些统计知识在生命科学文献中是无处不在的。下面我们以[这篇文章](http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/53/suppl_3/S215.full)作为例子：

```{block2 echo=FALSE}
Note that the abstract has this statement: 
```

&emsp;&emsp;注意这篇文章的摘要里面有如下的陈述：

```{block2 echo=FALSE}
> "Body weight was higher in mice fed the high-fat diet already after the first week, due to higher dietary intake in combination with lower metabolic efficiency." 
```


>&emsp;&emsp;"喂高脂饲料的老鼠在一周后其体重已经比较高了，这主要是由于高膳食摄入量和低代谢效率造成的。"

```{block2 echo=FALSE}
To support this claim they provide the following in the results section:
```

&emsp;&emsp;为了支持这一个结论，作者在结果部分提供了下面的结果：


```{block2 echo=FALSE}
> "Already during the first week after introduction of high-fat diet, body weight increased significantly more in the high-fat diet-fed mice ($+$ 1.6 $\pm$ 0.1 g) than in the normal diet-fed mice ($+$ 0.2 $\pm$ 0.1 g; P < 0.001)."
```

>&emsp;&emsp; “相对正常喂养的老鼠（$+$ 0.2 $\pm$ 0.1 g），喂养高脂饲料老鼠（$+$ 1.6 $\pm$ 0.1 g）的体重在一周后表现出体重的增加明显更多（P < 0.001）。”

```{block2 echo=FALSE}
What does P < 0.001 mean? What are the $\pm$ included? We will learn what this means and learn to compute these values in R. The first step is to understand random variables. To do this, we will use data from a mouse database (provided by Karen Svenson via Gary Churchill and Dan Gatti and partially funded by P50 GM070683). We will import the data into R and explain random variables and null distributions using R programming. 
```

&emsp;&emsp; P < 0.001的含义是什么？ $\pm$包含了什么内容？接下来你会学习这些内容，同时你也会学到如何在R中计算这些值。首先你要了解随机变量。这里我们使用一个小鼠的数据（这个数据是由Karen Svenson，Gary Churchill和Dan Gatti提供的，这个项目的部分经费来自于P50 GM070683）。我们将会把这个数据导入R，然后通过这个数据来讲解随机变量和.........

```{block2 echo=FALSE}
If you already downloaded the `femaleMiceWeights` file into your working directory, you can read it into R with just one line:
```

&emsp;&emsp; 如果你已经下载了`femaleMiceWeights`这个数据，并存放在了你的当前工作目录中，你可以用一行R代码来读取这个数据：


```{r echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
library(downloader) ##use install.packages to install
dir <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/master/inst/extdata/"
filename <- "femaleMiceWeights.csv"
url <- paste0(dir, filename)
if (!file.exists(filename)) download(url, destfile=filename)
```

```{r}
dat <- read.csv("femaleMiceWeights.csv")
```

```{block2 echo=FALSE}
Remember that a quick way to read the data, without downloading it is by using the url:
```

你也可以不用下载，直接通过数据对应的网址来读取数据：

```{r,eval=FALSE}
dir <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/master/inst/extdata/"
filename <- "femaleMiceWeights.csv"
url <- paste0(dir, filename)
dat <- read.csv(url)
```

```{block2 echo=FALSE}
### Our first look at data
```

### 认识数据

```{block2 echo=FALSE}
We are interested in determining if following a given diet makes mice heavier after several weeks. This data was produced by ordering 24 mice from The Jackson Lab and randomly assigning either chow or high fat (hf) diet. After several weeks, the scientists weighed each mouse and obtained this data (`head` just shows us the first 6 rows):
```

&emsp;&emsp;在这个数据中，我们感兴趣的是通过给小鼠提供高脂饲料几周后小鼠的体重是否增加的更多。24只从Jackson实验室订购的小鼠随机分成两组：对照组合高脂饲料组（HF:high fat）。在几周后，科学家会测量每个小数的体重。这里`head`向我们展示了数据的前六行。

  
```{r}
head(dat) 
``` 

```{block2 echo=FALSE}
In RStudio, you can view the entire dataset with:
```


&emsp;&emsp; 在RStudio中，你可以用`View()`函数来查看整个数据集:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
View(dat)
```

```{block2 echo=FALSE}
So are the hf mice heavier? Mouse 24 at 20.73 grams is one of the lightest mice, while Mouse 21 at 34.02 grams is one of the heaviest. Both are on the hf diet. Just from looking at the data, we see there is *variability*. Claims such as the one above usually refer to the averages. So let's look at the average of each group: 
```

&emsp;&emsp; 那么喂高脂饲料的小鼠（HF小鼠）是不是更重一些呢？第24只小鼠和第21只小鼠都属于HF小鼠。而第24只小鼠的体重是最轻的，为20.73克；第21只小鼠最重，为34.02克。仅从数值来看，即使在同一组小鼠中，我们能够看到*变异（variability）*的存在。如果结论是一组比另一组高，通常我们讲的是均值。


```{r,message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
control <- filter(dat,Diet=="chow") %>% select(Bodyweight) %>% unlist
treatment <- filter(dat,Diet=="hf") %>% select(Bodyweight) %>% unlist
print( mean(treatment) )
print( mean(control) )
obsdiff <- mean(treatment) - mean(control)
print(obsdiff)
```

```{block2 echo=FALSE}
So the hf diet mice are about 10% heavier. Are we done? Why do we need p-values and confidence intervals? The reason is that these averages are random variables. They can take many values. 
```

&emsp;&emsp; 从上面的R代码运行的结果，我们看到HF小鼠的体重均值为`mean(treatment)`，而对照组的均值为`mean(control)`。两均值之间的差值为`obsdiff`。HF小鼠的体重相对对照组要重10%。这样我们的分析就这结束了，可以下结论了吗？为什么我们需要P值和置信区间呢？原因是这些均值是随机变量。它们可以是很多值。


```{block2 echo=FALSE}
If we repeat the experiment, we obtain 24 new mice from The Jackson Laboratory and, after randomly assigning them to each diet, we get a different mean. Every time we repeat this experiment, we get a different value. We call this type of quantity a *random variable*. 
```

&emsp;&emsp; 如果我们重复这个实验。重新再订24只小鼠然后随机分成两组进行饲养，这组数据我们会得到一组不一样的均值。每次我们重复这个实验，我们会得到不同的值。我们成这样的数据类型：*随机变量*。

```{block2 echo=FALSE}
## Random Variables
```

## 随机变量

```{block2 echo=FALSE}
Let's explore random variables further. Imagine that we actually have the weight of all control female mice and can upload them to R. In Statistics, we refer to this as *the population*. These are all the control mice available from which we sampled 24. Note that in practice we do not have access to the population. We have a special dataset that we are using here to illustrate concepts. 
```

&emsp;&emsp;让我们进一步的来认识随机变量。假设我们有所有对照组雌性小鼠的体重数据。在统计中，我们称这个数据为*总体样本*。试验中的24只小鼠是这个总体样本中抽取的样本。需要记住的是在实践中我们是没有办法得到总体样本数据的。这里我们有一个特殊的数据来说明这个概念。

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(downloader)
dir <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/master/inst/extdata/"
filename <- "femaleControlsPopulation.csv"
url <- paste0(dir, filename)
##check if file exists and if it does not, download it:
if (!file.exists(filename)) download(url,destfile=filename)
```

```{block2 echo=FALSE}
The first step is to download the data from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/master/inst/extdata/femaleControlsPopulation.csv) into your working directory and then read it into R: 
```

&emsp;&emsp;第一步是从这里的连接中下载数据到对应的工作目录中，然后将数据读入R：


```{r}
population <- read.csv("femaleControlsPopulation.csv")
##use unlist to turn it into a numeric vector
population <- unlist(population) 
```

Now let's sample 12 mice three times and see how the average changes.


&emsp;&emsp;现在让我们从这个数据中进行三次抽样，每次抽取12只小鼠，并计算每次抽样的均值：


```{r}
control <- sample(population,12)
mean(control)

control <- sample(population,12)
mean(control)

control <- sample(population,12)
mean(control)
```

```{block2 echo=FALSE}
Note how the average varies. We can continue to do this repeatedly and start learning something about the distribution of this random variable.
```

&emsp;&emsp;我们可以注意到这里的均值的变化。我们可以重复这个操作很多次，然后来学习随机变量的分布。

```{block2 echo=FALSE}
## The Null Hypothesis
```

## 零假设

```{block2 echo=FALSE}
Now let's go back to our average difference of `obsdiff`. As scientists we need to be skeptics. How do we know that this `obsdiff` is due to the diet? What happens if we give all 24 mice the same diet? Will we see a difference this big? Statisticians refer to this scenario as the *null hypothesis*. The name "null" is used to remind us that we are acting as skeptics: we give credence to the possibility that there is no difference.
```

&emsp;&emsp;我们回到我们之前计算的均值差（`obsdiff`）。作为一个科研工作者，我们需要有怀疑精神。我们如何知道`obsdiff`是由于饲料差异引起的。如果我们给24只小鼠一样的饲料，结果会怎样呢？我们会看到这么大的差异吗？统计学家将这样的假设称为*零假设*。这里的“零”（英文为Null）是在提醒我们这里我们是怀疑论者：我们相信存在饲料差异不引起体重差异的可能性。

```{block2 echo=FALSE}
Because we have access to the population, we can actually observe as many values as we want of the difference of the averages when the diet has no effect. We can do this by randomly sampling 24 control mice, giving them the same diet, and then recording the difference in mean between two randomly split groups of 12 and 12. Here is this process written in R code:
```

&emsp;&emsp;我们可以从对照组雌性小鼠的体重数据随机取24只小鼠，然后提供相同的饲料。接着我们将这24只小鼠随机分成2组，每组12只，同时计算每组的均值。下面是完成这样系列操作的R代码：



```{r}
##12 control mice
control <- sample(population,12)
##another 12 control mice that we act as if they were not
treatment <- sample(population,12)
print(mean(treatment) - mean(control))
```

```{block2 echo=FALSE}
Now let's do it 10,000 times. We will use a "for-loop", an operation
that lets us automate this (a simpler approach that, we will learn later, is to use `replicate`).
```

&emsp;&emsp;我们接着重复10,000次上面的操作。这里我们将用到`for`循环，这个操作可以使得重复10,000次的操作自动完成（后面我们会介绍一种更简单的函数`replicate`）。


```{r}
n <- 10000
null <- vector("numeric",n)
for (i in 1:n) {
  control <- sample(population,12)
  treatment <- sample(population,12)
  null[i] <- mean(treatment) - mean(control)
}
```

```{block2 echo=FALSE}
The values in `null` form what we call the *null distribution*. We will define this more formally below.
```

&emsp;&emsp;我们称`null`中的数值分布为*零分布*(*null distribution*)。我们在接下来的部分会更详细的定义这个分布。

```{block2 echo=FALSE}
So what percent of the 10,000 are bigger than `obsdiff`?
```

&emsp;&emsp;那么在这10,000次随机取样中，小鼠体重的均值差异大于`obsdiff`的百分比是多少呢？



```{r}
mean(null >= obsdiff)
```

```{block2 echo=FALSE}
Only a small percent of the 10,000 simulations. As skeptics what do we conclude? When there is no diet effect, we see a difference as big as the one we observed only 1.5% of the time. This is what is known as a p-value, which we will define more formally later in the book. 
```
&emsp;&emsp;我们发现在这 10,000次随机取样中只有很小的百分比小鼠的体重均值差异大于`obsdiff`。作为怀疑论者，我们的结论是什么呢？当没有饲料差异时，随机取样情况下只有1.5%的可能性我们能观察到的均值差异大于我们的试验中的均值差异。这就是我们所知道的P值，我们在后面会有更正式的定义。

```{block2 echo=FALSE}
## Distributions
```

```{block2 echo=FALSE}
We have explained what we mean by *null* in the context of null hypothesis, but what exactly is a distribution? The simplest way to think of a *distribution* is as a compact description of many numbers. For example, suppose you have measured the heights of all men in a population. Imagine you need to describe these numbers to someone that has no idea what these heights are, such as an alien that has never visited Earth. Suppose all these heights are contained in the following dataset:
```

&emsp;&emsp;我们已经解释了零假设中的*零*（*null*）的意思，但是究竟分布指什么呢？最简单的方法是你可以将*分布*（*distribution* ）想成许多数字的一个描述。比如，假设你测量一个样本中的所有男性的身高。设想你要对其他人描述这些身高数值，而这些人对你的数据完全一无所知，比如从来没有到过地球的外星人。假设所有的数据都包含在下面的数据中了：


```{r definingHeights, message=FALSE}
data(father.son,package="UsingR")
x <- father.son$fheight
```

```{block2 echo=FALSE}
One approach to summarizing these numbers is to simply list them all out for the alien to see. Here are 10 randomly selected heights of 1,078:
```

&emsp;&emsp;一个方法是直接将所有的身高数值展示给外星人看。下面是我们从这1,078个数据中随机选取的10个：


```{r}
round(sample(x,10),1)
```

```{block2 echo=FALSE}
#### Cumulative Distribution Function
```

### 累积分布函数

```{block2 echo=FALSE}
Scanning through these numbers, we start to get a rough idea of what the entire list looks like, but it is certainly inefficient. We can quickly improve on this approach by defining and visualizing a _distribution_. To define a distribution we compute, for all possible values of $a$, the proportion of numbers in our list that are below $a$. We use the following notation:
```

&emsp;&emsp;浏览这些数据，我们大概知道整个数据是什么情况，但是这显然是不够的。我们可以通过展示这个数据的分布来进一步的理解数据。对于所有的可能


$$ F(a) \equiv \mbox{Pr}(x \leq a) $$

This is called the cumulative distribution function (CDF). When the CDF is derived from data, as opposed to theoretically, we also call it the empirical CDF (ECDF). The ECDF for the height data looks like this:

```{r ecdf,fig.cap="Empirical cummulative distribution function for height.", echo=FALSE}
smallest <- floor( min(x) )
largest <- ceiling( max(x) )
values <- seq(smallest, largest,len=300)
heightecdf <- ecdf(x)
plot(values, heightecdf(values), type="l",
     xlab="a (Height in inches)",ylab="Pr(x <= a)")
```

#### Histograms

Although the empirical CDF concept is widely discussed in statistics textbooks, the plot is actually not very popular in practice. The reason is that histograms give us the same information and are easier to interpret. Histograms show us the
proportion of values in intervals: 

$$ \mbox{Pr}(a \leq x \leq b) = F(b) - F(a) $$

Plotting these heights as bars is what we call a _histogram_. It is a
more useful plot because we are usually more interested in intervals,
such and such percent are between 70 inches and 71 inches, etc.,
rather than the percent less than a particular height.
It is also easier to distinguish different types (families) of distributions
by looking at histograms. Here is a histogram of heights: 

```{r hist, eval=FALSE}
hist(x)
```

We can specify the bins and add better labels in the following way:
```{r histogram, fig.cap="Histogram for heights."}
bins <- seq(smallest, largest)
hist(x,breaks=bins,xlab="Height (in inches)",main="Adult men heights")
```

Showing this plot to the alien is much more informative than showing numbers. With this simple plot, we can approximate the number of individuals in any given interval. For example, there are about 70 individuals over six feet (72 inches) tall. 


## Probability Distribution

Summarizing lists of numbers is one powerful use of distribution. An
even more important use is describing the possible outcomes of a
random variable. Unlike a fixed list of numbers, we don't actually observe all possible outcomes of random variables, so instead of describing proportions, we describe
probabilities. For instance, if we pick a random height from our list,
then the probability of it falling between $a$ and $b$ is denoted with: 

$$ \mbox{Pr}(a \leq X \leq b) = F(b) - F(a) $$

Note that the $X$ is now capitalized to distinguish it as a random
variable and that the equation above defines the probability
distribution of the random variable. Knowing this distribution is
incredibly useful in science. For example, in the case above, if we
know the distribution of the difference in mean of mouse weights
when the null hypothesis is true, referred to as the _null distribution_, we can
compute the probability of observing a value as large as we did,
referred to as a _p-value_. In a previous section we ran what is
called a _Monte Carlo_ simulation (we will provide more details on
Monte Carlo simulation in a later section) and we obtained 10,000
outcomes of the random variable under the null hypothesis.  Let's
repeat the loop above, but this time let's add a point to the figure
every time we re-run the experiment. If you run this code, you can see
the null distribution forming as the observed values stack on top of
each other. 

```{r null_distribution_illustration,fig.cap="Illustration of the null distribution."}
n <- 100
library(rafalib)
nullplot(-5,5,1,30, xlab="Observed differences (grams)", ylab="Frequency")
totals <- vector("numeric",11)
for (i in 1:n) {
  control <- sample(population,12)
  treatment <- sample(population,12)
  nulldiff <- mean(treatment) - mean(control)
  j <- pmax(pmin(round(nulldiff)+6,11),1)
  totals[j] <- totals[j]+1
  text(j-6,totals[j],pch=15,round(nulldiff,1))
  ##if(i < 15) Sys.sleep(1) ##You can add this line to see values appear slowly
  }
```

The figure above amounts to a histogram. From a histogram of the
`null` vector we calculated earlier, we can see that values as large
as `obsdiff` are relatively rare: 

```{r null_and_obs, fig.cap="Null distribution with observed difference marked with vertical red line."}
hist(null, freq=TRUE)
abline(v=obsdiff, col="red", lwd=2)
```

An important point to keep in mind here is that while we defined $\mbox{Pr}(a)$ by counting cases, we will learn that, in some circumstances, mathematics gives us formulas for $\mbox{Pr}(a)$ that save us the trouble of computing them as we did here. One example of this powerful approach uses the normal distribution approximation.


## Normal Distribution

The probability distribution we see above approximates one that is very common in nature: the bell curve, also known as the normal distribution or Gaussian distribution. When the histogram of a list of numbers approximates the normal distribution, we can use a convenient mathematical formula to approximate the proportion of values or outcomes in any given interval:

$$
\mbox{Pr}(a < x < b) = \int_a^b \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp{\left( \frac{-(x-\mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2} \right)} \, dx
$$

While the formula may look intimidating, don't worry, you will never
actually have to type it out, as it is stored in a more convenient
form (as `pnorm` in R which sets *a* to $-\infty$, and takes *b* as an argument). 

Here $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are referred to as the mean and the standard
deviation of the population (we explain these in more detail in
another section). If this *normal approximation* holds for our list, then the
population mean and variance of our list can be used in the formula
above. An example of this would be when we noted above that only 1.5%
of values on the null distribution were above `obsdiff`. We can
compute the proportion of values below a value `x` with
`pnorm(x,mu,sigma)` without knowing all the values. The normal
approximation works very well here: 

```{r}
1 - pnorm(obsdiff,mean(null),sd(null)) 
```

Later, we will learn that there is a mathematical explanation for this. A very useful characteristic of this approximation is that one only needs to know $\mu$ and $\sigma$ to describe the entire distribution. From this, we can compute the proportion of values in any interval. 


#### Summary

So computing a p-value for the difference in diet for the mice was
pretty easy, right? But why are we not done? To make the calculation,
we did the equivalent of buying all the mice available from The
Jackson Laboratory and performing our experiment repeatedly to define
the null distribution. Yet this is not something we can do in
practice. Statistical Inference is the mathematical theory that
permits you to approximate this with only the data from your sample,
i.e. the original 24 mice. We will focus on this in the following
sections.

#### Setting the random seed

Before we continue, we briefly explain the following important line of
code:

```{r}
set.seed(1) 
```

Throughout this book, we use random number generators. This implies that many of the results presented can actually change by chance, including the correct answer to problems. One way to ensure that results do not change is by setting R's random number generation seed. For more on the topic please read the help file:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
?set.seed
```






## Populations, Samples and Estimates 

Now that we have introduced the idea of a random variable, a null distribution, and a p-value, we are ready to describe the mathematical theory that permits us to compute p-values in practice. We will also learn about confidence intervals and power calculations. 

#### Population parameters

A first step in statistical inference is to understand what population
you are interested in. In the mouse weight example, we have two
populations: female mice on control diets and female mice on high fat
diets, with weight being the outcome of interest. We consider this
population to be fixed, and the randomness comes from the
sampling. One reason we have been using this dataset as an example is
because we happen to have the weights of all the mice of this
type. We download [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/master/inst/extdata/mice_pheno.csv) file to our working directory and read in to R:

```{r,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
library(downloader)
dir <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/master/inst/extdata/"
filename <- "mice_pheno.csv"
url <- paste0(dir, filename)
if (!file.exists(filename)) download(url,destfile=filename)
```

```{r}
dat <- read.csv("mice_pheno.csv")
```

We can then access the population values and determine, for example, how many we have. Here we compute the size of the control population:

```{r,message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
controlPopulation <- filter(dat,Sex == "F" & Diet == "chow") %>% 
  select(Bodyweight) %>% unlist
length(controlPopulation)
```

We usually denote these values as $x_1,\dots,x_m$. In this case, $m$ is the number computed above. We can do the same for the high fat diet population:

```{r}
hfPopulation <- filter(dat,Sex == "F" & Diet == "hf") %>%  
  select(Bodyweight) %>% unlist
length(hfPopulation)
```

and denote with $y_1,\dots,y_n$.

We can then define summaries of interest for these populations, such as the mean and variance. 

The mean:

$$\mu_X = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m x_i \mbox{ and } \mu_Y = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n y_i$$

The variance:

$$\sigma_X^2 = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m (x_i-\mu_X)^2 \mbox{ and } \sigma_Y^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\mu_Y)^2$$

with the standard deviation being the square root of the variance. We refer to such quantities that can be obtained from the population as _population parameters_. The question we started out asking can now be written mathematically: is $\mu_Y - \mu_X = 0$ ? 

Although in our illustration we have all the values and can check if this is true, in practice we do not. For example, in practice it would be prohibitively expensive to buy all the mice in a population. Here we learn how taking a _sample_ permits us to answer our questions. This is the essence of statistical inference.

#### Sample estimates

In the previous chapter, we obtained samples of 12 mice from each
population. We represent data from samples with capital letters to
indicate that they are random. This is common practice in statistics,
although it is not always followed. So the samples are $X_1,\dots,X_M$
and $Y_1,\dots,Y_N$ and, in this case, $N=M=12$. In contrast and as we
saw above, when we list out the values of the population, which are
set and not random, we use lower-case letters.

Since we want to know if $\mu_Y - \mu_X$ is 0, we consider the sample version: $\bar{Y}-\bar{X}$  with: 

$$
\bar{X}=\frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^M X_i 
\mbox{ and }\bar{Y}=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N Y_i.
$$

Note that this difference of averages is also a random
variable. Previously, we learned about the behavior of random variables
with an exercise that involved repeatedly sampling from the original
distribution. Of course, this is not an exercise that we can execute
in practice. In this particular case it would involve buying 24 mice
over and over again. Here we described the mathematical theory that
mathematically relates $\bar{X}$ to $\mu_X$ and $\bar{Y}$ to $\mu_Y$,
that will in turn help us understand the relationship between
$\bar{Y}-\bar{X}$  and $\mu_Y - \mu_X$. Specifically, we will describe
how the Central Limit Theorem permits us to use an approximation to
answer this question, as well as motivate the widely used t-distribution.

### Population, Samples, and Estimates Exercises

__Exercises__

For these exercises, we will be using the following dataset:

```
library(downloader) 
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/master/inst/extdata/mice_pheno.csv"
filename <- basename(url)
download(url, destfile=filename)
dat <- read.csv(filename)
```

We will remove the lines that contain missing values:

```
dat <- na.omit( dat )
```

1. Use `dplyr` to create a vector `x` with the body weight of all males on the control (`chow`) diet. What is this population’s average?

2. Now use the `rafalib` package and use the `popsd` function to compute the population standard deviation.

3. Set the seed at 1. Take a random sample $X of size 25 from `x`. What is the sample average?

4. Use `dplyr` to create a vector `y` with the body weight of all males on the high fat (`hf`) diet. What is this population’s average?

5. Now use the `rafalib` package and use the `popsd` function to compute the population standard deviation.

6. Set the seed at 1. Take a random sample $Y of size 25 from `y`. What is the sample average?

7. What is the difference in absolute value between $\bar{y}−\bar{x}$ and $\bar{X}-\bar{Y}$?

8. Repeat the above for females. Make sure to set the seed to 1 before each `sample` call. What is the difference in absolute value between $\bar{y}−\bar{x}$ and $\bar{X}-\bar{Y}$?

9. For the females, our sample estimates were closer to the population difference than with males. What is a possible explanation for this?


*　A) The population variance of the females is smaller than that of the males; thus, the sample variable has less variability.
*　B) Statistical estimates are more precise for females.
* C) The sample size was larger for females.
* D) The sample size was smaller for females.







## Central Limit Theorem and t-distribution


Below we will discuss the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and the t-distribution, both of which help us make important calculations related to probabilities. Both are frequently used in science to test statistical hypotheses. To use these, we have to make different assumptions from those for the CLT and the t-distribution. However, if the assumptions are true, then we are able to calculate the exact probabilities of events through the use of mathematical formula.

#### Central Limit Theorem 

The CLT is one of the most frequently used mathematical results in science. It tells us that when the sample size is large, the average $\bar{Y}$ of a random sample follows a normal distribution centered at the population average $\mu_Y$ and with standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation $\sigma_Y$, divided by the square root of the sample size $N$. We refer to the standard deviation of the distribution of a random variable as the random variable's _standard error_.

Please note that if we subtract a constant from a random variable, the
mean of the new random variable shifts by that
constant. Mathematically, if $X$ is a random variable with mean $\mu$
and $a$ is a constant, the mean of $X - a$ is $\mu-a$. A similarly
intuitive result holds for multiplication and the standard deviation (SD).
If $X$ is a random
variable with mean $\mu$ and SD $\sigma$, and $a$ is a constant, then
the mean and SD of $aX$ are $a \mu$ and $\mid a \mid \sigma$
respectively. To see how intuitive this is, imagine that we subtract
10 grams from each of the mice weights. The average weight should also
drop by that much. Similarly, if we change the units from grams to
milligrams by multiplying by 1000, then the spread of the numbers
becomes larger. 

This implies that if we take many samples of size $N$, then the quantity: 

$$
\frac{\bar{Y} - \mu}{\sigma_Y/\sqrt{N}}
$$

is approximated with a normal distribution centered at 0 and with standard deviation 1.

Now we are interested in the difference between two sample averages. Here again a mathematical result helps. If we have two random variables $X$ and $Y$ with means $\mu_X$ and $\mu_Y$ and variance $\sigma_X$ and $\sigma_Y$ respectively, then we have the following result: the mean of the sum $Y + X$ is the sum of the means $\mu_Y + \mu_X$. Using one of the facts we mentioned earlier, this implies that the mean of $Y - X = Y + aX$ with $a = -1$ , which implies that the mean of $Y - X$ is $\mu_Y - \mu_X$. This is intuitive. However, the next result is perhaps not as intuitive.  If $X$ and $Y$ are independent of each other, as they are in our mouse example, then the variance (SD squared) of $Y + X$ is the sum of the variances $\sigma_Y^2 + \sigma_X^2$. This implies that variance of the difference $Y - X$ is the variance of $Y + aX$ with $a = -1$ which is $\sigma^2_Y + a^2 \sigma_X^2 = \sigma^2_Y + \sigma_X^2$. So the variance of the difference is also the sum of the variances. If this seems like a counterintuitive result, remember that if $X$ and $Y$ are independent of each other, the sign does not really matter. It can be considered random: if $X$ is normal with certain variance, for example, so is $-X$.  Finally, another useful result is that the sum of normal variables is again normal.

All this math is very helpful for the purposes of our study because we have two sample averages and are interested in the difference. Because both are normal, the difference is normal as well, and the variance (the standard deviation squared) is the sum of the two variances.
Under the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the population averages, the difference between the sample averages $\bar{Y}-\bar{X}$, with $\bar{X}$ and $\bar{Y}$ the sample average for the two diets respectively, is approximated by a normal distribution centered at 0 (there is no difference) and with standard deviation $\sqrt{\sigma_X^2 +\sigma_Y^2}/\sqrt{N}$. 

This suggests that this ratio:

$$
\frac{\bar{Y}-\bar{X}}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_X^2}{M} + \frac{\sigma_Y^2}{N}}}
$$

is approximated by a normal distribution centered at 0 and standard deviation 1.  Using this approximation makes computing p-values simple because we know the proportion of the distribution under any value. For example, only 5% of these values are larger than 2 (in absolute value):

```{r}
pnorm(-2) + (1 - pnorm(2))
```

We don't need to buy more mice, 12 and 12 suffice.

However, we can't claim victory just yet because we don't know the population standard deviations: $\sigma_X$ and $\sigma_Y$. These are unknown population parameters, but we can get around this by using the sample standard deviations, call them $s_X$ and $s_Y$. These are defined as: 

$$ s_X^2 = \frac{1}{M-1} \sum_{i=1}^M (X_i - \bar{X})^2  \mbox{ and }  s_Y^2 = \frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^N (Y_i - \bar{Y})^2 $$

Note that we are dividing by $M-1$ and $N-1$, instead of by $M$ and $N$. There is a theoretical reason for doing this which we do not explain here. But to get an intuition, think of the case when you just have 2 numbers. The average distance to the mean is basically 1/2 the difference between the two numbers. So you really just have information from one number. This is somewhat of a minor point. The main point is that $s_X$ and $s_Y$ serve as estimates of $\sigma_X$ and $\sigma_Y$

So we can redefine our ratio as

$$
\sqrt{N} \frac{\bar{Y}-\bar{X}}{\sqrt{s_X^2 +s_Y^2}}
$$

if $M=N$ or in general,

$$
\frac{\bar{Y}-\bar{X}}{\sqrt{\frac{s_X^2}{M} + \frac{s_Y^2}{N}}}
$$

The CLT tells us that when $M$ and $N$ are large, this random variable is normally distributed with mean 0 and SD 1. Thus we can compute p-values using the function `pnorm`.

#### The t-distribution

The CLT relies on large samples, what we refer to as _asymptotic results_. When the CLT does not apply, there is another option that does not rely on asymptotic results. When the original population from which a random variable, say $Y$, is sampled is normally distributed with mean 0, then we can calculate the distribution of: 

$$
\sqrt{N} \frac{\bar{Y}}{s_Y}
$$

This is the ratio of two random variables so it is not
necessarily normal. The fact that the denominator can be small by
chance increases the probability of observing large
values. [William Sealy Gosset](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sealy_Gosset),
an employee of the Guinness brewing company, deciphered the
distribution of this random variable and published a paper under the
pseudonym "Student". The distribution is therefore called Student's
t-distribution. Later we will learn more about how this result is
used. 

Here we will use the mice phenotype data as an example. We start by
creating two vectors, one for the control population and one for the
high-fat diet population:

```{r,message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
dat <- read.csv("mice_pheno.csv") #We downloaded this file in a previous section
controlPopulation <- filter(dat,Sex == "F" & Diet == "chow") %>%  
  select(Bodyweight) %>% unlist
hfPopulation <- filter(dat,Sex == "F" & Diet == "hf") %>%  
  select(Bodyweight) %>% unlist
```

It is important to keep in mind that what we are assuming to be normal here is the distribution of $y_1,y_2,\dots,y_n$, not the random variable $\bar{Y}$. Although we can't do this in practice, in this illustrative example, we get to see this distribution for both controls and high fat diet mice:

```{r population_histograms, fig.cap="Histograms of all weights for both populations.",fig.width=10.5,fig.height=5.25}
library(rafalib)
mypar(1,2)
hist(hfPopulation)
hist(controlPopulation)
```

We can use *qq-plots* to confirm that the distributions are relatively
close to being normally distributed. We will explore these plots in
more depth in a later section, but the important thing to know is that
it compares data (on the y-axis) against a theoretical distribution
(on the x-axis). If the points fall on the identity line, then the
data is close to the theoretical distribution.

```{r population_qqplots, fig.cap="Quantile-quantile plots of all weights for both populations.",fig.width=10.5,fig.height=5.25}
mypar(1,2)
qqnorm(hfPopulation)
qqline(hfPopulation)
qqnorm(controlPopulation)
qqline(controlPopulation)
```

The larger the sample, the more forgiving the result is to the
weakness of this approximation. In the next section, we will see that
for this particular dataset the t-distribution works well even for
sample sizes as small as 3. 


```{r,results=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
set.seed(1) 
```

## Central Limit Theorem in Practice

Let's use our data to see how well the central limit theorem approximates sample averages from our data. We will leverage our entire population dataset to compare the results we obtain by actually sampling from the distribution to what the CLT predicts.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(downloader)
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/master/inst/extdata/mice_pheno.csv"
filename <- "mice_pheno.csv"
if (!file.exists(filename)) download(url,destfile=filename)
```

```{r}
dat <- read.csv("mice_pheno.csv") #file was previously downloaded
head(dat)
```

Start by selecting only female mice since males and females have
different weights. We will select three mice from each population.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
controlPopulation <- filter(dat,Sex == "F" & Diet == "chow") %>%  
  select(Bodyweight) %>% unlist
hfPopulation <- filter(dat,Sex == "F" & Diet == "hf") %>%  
  select(Bodyweight) %>% unlist
```

We can compute the population parameters of interest using the mean function.

```{r}
mu_hf <- mean(hfPopulation)
mu_control <- mean(controlPopulation)
print(mu_hf - mu_control)
```

We can compute the population standard deviations of, say, a vector $x$ as well. However, we do not use the R function `sd` because this function actually does not compute the population standard deviation $\sigma_x$. Instead, `sd` assumes the main argument is a random sample, say $X$, and provides an estimate of $\sigma_x$, defined by $s_X$ above. As shown in the equations above the actual final answer differs because one divides by the sample size and the other by the sample size minus one. We can see that with R code:

```{r}
x <- controlPopulation
N <- length(x)
populationvar <- mean((x-mean(x))^2)
identical(var(x), populationvar)
identical(var(x)*(N-1)/N, populationvar)
```

So to be mathematically correct, we do not use `sd` or  `var`. Instead, we use the `popvar` and `popsd` function in `rafalib`:

```{r}
library(rafalib)
sd_hf <- popsd(hfPopulation)
sd_control <- popsd(controlPopulation)
```

Remember that in practice we do not get to compute these population parameters.
These are values we never see. In general, we want to estimate them from samples. 

```{r}
N <- 12
hf <- sample(hfPopulation, 12)
control <- sample(controlPopulation, 12)
```

As we described, the CLT tells us that for large $N$, each of these is approximately normal with average population mean and standard error population variance divided by $N$. We mentioned that a rule of thumb is that $N$ should be 30 or more. However, that is just a rule of thumb since the preciseness of the approximation depends on the population distribution. Here we can actually check the approximation and we do that for various values of $N$.

Now we use `sapply` and `replicate` instead of `for` loops, which
makes for cleaner code (we do not have to pre-allocate a vector, R
takes care of this for us):

```{r}
Ns <- c(3,12,25,50)
B <- 10000 #number of simulations
res <-  sapply(Ns,function(n) {
  replicate(B,mean(sample(hfPopulation,n))-mean(sample(controlPopulation,n)))
})
```

Now we can use qq-plots to see how well CLT approximations works for these. If in fact the normal distribution is a good approximation, the points should fall on a straight line when compared to normal quantiles. The more it deviates, the worse the approximation. In the title, we also show the average and SD of the observed distribution, which demonstrates how the SD decreases with $\sqrt{N}$ as predicted. 

```{r effect_size_qqplot,fig.cap="Quantile versus quantile plot of simulated differences versus theoretical normal distribution for four different sample sizes.",fig.width=7.5,fig.height=7.5}
mypar(2,2)
for (i in seq(along=Ns)) {
  titleavg <- signif(mean(res[,i]),3)
  titlesd <- signif(popsd(res[,i]),3)
  title <- paste0("N=",Ns[i]," Avg=",titleavg," SD=",titlesd)
  qqnorm(res[,i],main=title)
  qqline(res[,i],col=2)
}
```

Here we see a pretty good fit even for 3. Why is this? Because the
population itself is relatively close to normally distributed, the
averages are close to normal as well (the sum of normals is also a
normal). In practice, we actually calculate a ratio: we divide by the
estimated standard deviation. Here is where the sample size starts to
matter more. 

```{r t_test_qqplot,fig.cap="Quantile versus quantile plot of simulated ratios versus theoretical normal distribution for four different sample sizes.",fig.width=7.5,fig.height=7.5}
Ns <- c(3,12,25,50)
B <- 10000 #number of simulations
##function to compute a t-stat
computetstat <- function(n) {
  y <- sample(hfPopulation,n)
  x <- sample(controlPopulation,n)
  (mean(y)-mean(x))/sqrt(var(y)/n+var(x)/n)
}
res <-  sapply(Ns,function(n) {
  replicate(B,computetstat(n))
})
mypar(2,2)
for (i in seq(along=Ns)) {
  qqnorm(res[,i],main=Ns[i])
  qqline(res[,i],col=2)
}
```

So we see that for $N=3$, the CLT does not provide a usable
approximation. For $N=12$, there is a slight deviation at the higher
values, although the approximation appears useful. For 25 and 50, the
approximation is spot on.

This simulation only proves that $N=12$ is large enough in this case,
not in general. As mentioned above, we will not be able to perform
this simulation in most situations. We only use the simulation to
illustrate the concepts behind the CLT and its limitations. In future
sections, we will describe the approaches we actually use in practice. 



## t-tests in Practice

#### Introduction

We will now demonstrate how to obtain a p-value in practice. We begin by loading experimental data and walking you through the steps used to form a t-statistic and compute a p-value. We can perform this task with just a few lines of code (go to the end of this section to see them). However, to understand the concepts, we will construct a t-statistic from "scratch".


#### Read in and prepare data

We start by reading in the data. A first important step is to identify
which rows are associated with treatment and control, and to compute
the difference in mean. 

```{r,message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
dat <- read.csv("femaleMiceWeights.csv") #previously downloaded

control <- filter(dat,Diet=="chow") %>% select(Bodyweight) %>% unlist
treatment <- filter(dat,Diet=="hf") %>% select(Bodyweight) %>% unlist

diff <- mean(treatment) - mean(control)
print(diff)
```

We are asked to report a p-value. What do we do? We learned that
`diff`, referred to as the _observed effect size_, is a random
variable. We also learned that under the null hypothesis, the mean of the distribution of `diff` is 0. What about the standard error? We also learned that the standard error of this random variable is the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size:

$$ SE(\bar{X}) = \sigma / \sqrt{N}$$

We use the sample standard deviation as an estimate of the population
standard deviation. In R, we simply use the `sd` function and the SE is:

```{r}
sd(control)/sqrt(length(control))
```

This is the SE of the sample average, but we actually want the SE of `diff`. We saw how statistical theory tells us that the variance of the difference of two random variables is the sum of its variances, so we compute the variance and take the square root:

```{r}
se <- sqrt( 
  var(treatment)/length(treatment) + 
  var(control)/length(control) 
  )
```

Statistical theory tells us that if we divide a random variable by its
SE, we get a new random variable with an SE of 1.

```{r}
tstat <- diff/se 
```

This ratio is what we call the t-statistic. It's the ratio of two random variables and thus a random variable. Once we know the distribution of this random variable, we can then easily compute a p-value.

As explained in the previous section, the CLT tells us that for large sample sizes, both sample averages `mean(treatment)` and `mean(control)` are normal. Statistical theory tells us that the difference of two normally distributed random variables is again normal, so CLT tells us that `tstat` is approximately normal with mean 0 (the null hypothesis) and SD 1 (we divided by its SE). 

So now to calculate a p-value all we need to do is ask: how often does
a normally distributed random variable exceed `diff`? R has a built-in
function, `pnorm`, to answer this specific question. `pnorm(a)` returns
the probability that a random variable following the standard normal
distribution falls below `a`. To obtain the probability that it is
larger than `a`, we simply use `1-pnorm(a)`. We want to know the
probability of seeing something as extreme as `diff`: either smaller
(more negative) than `-abs(diff)` or larger than `abs(diff)`. We call
these two regions "tails" and calculate their size:

```{r}
righttail <- 1 - pnorm(abs(tstat)) 
lefttail <- pnorm(-abs(tstat))
pval <- lefttail + righttail
print(pval)
```

In this case, the p-value is smaller than 0.05 and using the conventional cutoff of 0.05, we would call the difference _statistically significant_.

Now there is a problem. CLT works for large samples, but is 12 large enough? A rule of thumb for CLT is that 30 is a large enough sample size (but this is just a rule of thumb). The p-value we computed is only a valid approximation if the assumptions hold, which do not seem to be the case here. However, there is another option other than using CLT.

<a name="smallsample"></a>

## The t-distribution in Practice

As described earlier, statistical theory offers another useful
result. If the distribution of the population is normal, then we can
work out the exact distribution of the t-statistic without the need
for the CLT. This is a big "if" given that, with small
samples, it is hard to check if the population is normal. But for
something like weight, we suspect that the population distribution is
likely well approximated by normal and that we can use this
approximation. Furthermore, we can look at a qq-plot for the
samples. This shows that the approximation is at least close: 

```{r data_qqplot, fig.cap="Quantile-quantile plots for sample against theoretical normal distribution.", fig.width=10.5,fig.height=5.25}
library(rafalib)
mypar(1,2)

qqnorm(treatment)
qqline(treatment,col=2)

qqnorm(control)
qqline(control,col=2)
```

If we use this approximation, then statistical theory tells us that
the distribution of the random variable `tstat` follows a
t-distribution. This is a much more complicated distribution than the
normal. The t-distribution has a location parameter like the normal
and another parameter called *degrees of freedom*. R has a nice
function that actually computes everything for us. 

```{r}
t.test(treatment, control)
```

To see just the p-value, we can use the `$` extractor:

```{r}
result <- t.test(treatment,control)
result$p.value
```


The p-value is slightly bigger now. This is to be expected because our
CLT approximation considered the denominator of `tstat` practically
fixed (with large samples it practically is), while the t-distribution
approximation takes into account that the denominator (the standard
error of the difference) is a random variable. The smaller the
sample size, the more the denominator varies. 

It may be confusing that one approximation gave us one p-value and another gave us another, because we expect there to be just one answer. However, this is not uncommon in data analysis. We used different assumptions, different approximations, and therefore we obtained different results.

Later, in the power calculation section, we will describe type I and
type II errors. As a preview, we will point out that the test based on
the CLT approximation is more likely to incorrectly reject the null
hypothesis (a false positive), while the t-distribution is more likely
to incorrectly accept the null hypothesis (false negative).

#### Running the t-test in practice

Now that we have gone over the concepts, we can show the relatively
simple code that one would use to actually compute a t-test: 


```{r,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
library(downloader)
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/master/inst/extdata/mice_pheno.csv"
filename <- "mice_pheno.csv"
if(!file.exists(filename)) download(url,destfile=filename)
```

```{r,message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
dat <- read.csv("mice_pheno.csv")
control <- filter(dat,Diet=="chow") %>% select(Bodyweight) 
treatment <- filter(dat,Diet=="hf") %>% select(Bodyweight) 
t.test(treatment,control)
```

The arguments to `t.test` can be of type *data.frame* and thus we do not need to unlist them into numeric objects.



```{r,results=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
set.seed(1) ##so that we get same results
```

## Confidence Intervals

We have described how to compute p-values which are ubiquitous in the
life sciences. However, we do not recommend reporting p-values as the
only statistical summary of your results. The reason is simple:
statistical significance does not guarantee scientific
significance. With large enough sample sizes, one might detect a
statistically significance difference in weight of, say, 1
microgram. But is this an important finding? Would we say a diet
results in higher weight if the increase is less than a fraction of a
percent? The problem with reporting only p-values is that you will not
provide a very important piece of information: the effect size. Recall
that the effect size is the observed difference. Sometimes the effect
size is divided by the mean of the control group and so expressed as a
percent increase. 

A much more attractive alternative is to report confidence
intervals. A confidence interval includes information about your
estimated effect size and the uncertainty associated with this
estimate. Here we use the mice data to illustrate the concept behind
confidence intervals. 

#### Confidence Interval for Population Mean

Before we show how to construct a confidence interval for the
difference between the two groups, we will
show how to construct a confidence interval for the
population mean of control female mice.
Then we will return to the group difference after we've learned how to build
confidence intervals in the simple case.
We start by reading in the data and selecting the appropriate rows:

```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(downloader)
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/master/inst/extdata/mice_pheno.csv"
filename <- "mice_pheno.csv"
if (!file.exists(filename)) download(url,destfile=filename)
```

```{r}
dat <- read.csv("mice_pheno.csv")
chowPopulation <- dat[dat$Sex=="F" & dat$Diet=="chow",3]
```

The population average $\mu_X$ is our parameter of interest here:

```{r}
mu_chow <- mean(chowPopulation)
print(mu_chow)
```

We are interested in estimating this parameter. In practice, we do not get to see the entire population so, as we did for p-values, we demonstrate how we can use samples to do this. Let's start with a sample of size 30:

```{r}
N <- 30
chow <- sample(chowPopulation,N)
print(mean(chow))
```

We know this is a random variable, so the sample average will not be a perfect estimate. In fact, because in this illustrative example we know the value of the parameter, we can see that they are not exactly the same. A confidence interval is a statistical way of reporting our finding, the sample average, in a way that explicitly summarizes the variability of our random variable.

With a sample size of 30, we will use the CLT. The CLT tells us that $\bar{X}$ or `mean(chow)` follows a normal distribution with mean $\mu_X$ or `mean(chowPopulation)` and standard error approximately  $s_X/\sqrt{N}$ or:

```{r}
se <- sd(chow)/sqrt(N)
print(se)
```

<a name="interval"></a>

#### Defining the Interval

A 95% confidence interval (we can use percentages other than 95%) is a
random interval with a 95% probability of falling on the parameter we
are estimating. Keep in mind that saying 95% of random intervals will fall on the
true value (our definition above) is *not the same* as saying there is
a 95% chance that the true value falls in our interval. 
To construct it, we note that the CLT tells us that 
$\sqrt{N} (\bar{X}-\mu_X) / s_X$ follows a normal distribution with mean 0 and
SD 1. This implies that the probability of this event:

$$
-2 \leq \sqrt{N} (\bar{X}-\mu_X)/s_X \leq 2
$$  

which written in R code is:

```{r}
pnorm(2) - pnorm(-2)
```

...is about 95% (to get closer use `qnorm(1-0.05/2)` instead of
2). Now do some basic algebra to clear out everything and leave
$\mu_X$ alone in the middle and you get that the following event: 

$$
\bar{X}-2 s_X/\sqrt{N} \leq \mu_X \leq \bar{X}+2s_X/\sqrt{N}
$$  

has a probability of 95%. 

Be aware that it is the edges of the interval 
$\bar{X} \pm 2 s_X / \sqrt{N}$, not $\mu_X$, 
that are random. Again, the definition of
the confidence interval is that 95% of *random intervals* will contain
the true, fixed value $\mu_X$. For a specific interval that has been
calculated, the probability is either 0 or 1 that it contains the
fixed population mean $\mu_X$.

Let's demonstrate this logic through simulation. We can construct this
interval with R relatively easily: 

```{r}
Q <- qnorm(1- 0.05/2)
interval <- c(mean(chow)-Q*se, mean(chow)+Q*se )
interval
interval[1] < mu_chow & interval[2] > mu_chow
```

which happens to cover $\mu_X$ or `mean(chowPopulation)`. However, we can take another sample and we might not be as lucky. In fact, the theory tells us that we will cover $\mu_X$ 95% of the time. Because we have access to the population data, we can confirm this by taking several new samples:

```{r confidence_interval_n30,fig.cap="We show 250 random realizations of 95% confidence intervals. The color denotes if the interval fell on the parameter or not.",fig.height=8}
library(rafalib)
B <- 250
mypar()
plot(mean(chowPopulation)+c(-7,7),c(1,1),type="n",
     xlab="weight",ylab="interval",ylim=c(1,B))
abline(v=mean(chowPopulation))
for (i in 1:B) {
  chow <- sample(chowPopulation,N)
  se <- sd(chow)/sqrt(N)
  interval <- c(mean(chow)-Q*se, mean(chow)+Q*se)
  covered <- 
    mean(chowPopulation) <= interval[2] & mean(chowPopulation) >= interval[1]
  color <- ifelse(covered,1,2)
  lines(interval, c(i,i),col=color)
}
```

You can run this repeatedly to see what happens. You will see that in about 5% of the cases, we fail to cover $\mu_X$.

<a name="smallsample"></a>

#### Small Sample Size and the CLT

For $N=30$, the CLT works very well. However, if $N=5$, do these confidence intervals work as well? We used the CLT to create our intervals, and with $N=5$ it may not be as useful an approximation. We can confirm this with a simulation:


```{r confidence_interval_n5,fig.cap="We show 250 random realizations of 95% confidence intervals, but now for a smaller sample size. The confidence interval is based on the CLT approximation. The color denotes if the interval fell on the parameter or not.",fig.height=8}
mypar()
plot(mean(chowPopulation)+c(-7,7),c(1,1),type="n",
     xlab="weight",ylab="interval",ylim=c(1,B))
abline(v=mean(chowPopulation))
Q <- qnorm(1- 0.05/2)
N <- 5
for (i in 1:B) {
  chow <- sample(chowPopulation,N)
  se <- sd(chow)/sqrt(N)
  interval <- c(mean(chow)-Q*se, mean(chow)+Q*se)
  covered <- mean(chowPopulation) <= interval[2] & mean(chowPopulation) >= interval[1]
  color <- ifelse(covered,1,2)
  lines(interval, c(i,i),col=color)
}
```

Despite the intervals being larger (we are dividing by $\sqrt{5}$
instead of $\sqrt{30}$ ), we see many more intervals not covering
$\mu_X$. This is because the CLT is incorrectly telling us that the
distribution of the `mean(chow)` is approximately normal with standard deviation 1 when, in fact,
it has a larger standard deviation and a fatter tail (the parts of the distribution going to
$\pm \infty$). This mistake affects us in the calculation of `Q`, which assumes a normal distribution and uses `qnorm`. The t-distribution might be more appropriate. All we have to do is re-run the above, but change how we calculate `Q` to use `qt` instead of `qnorm`.

```{r confidence_interval_tdist_n5,fig.cap="We show 250 random realizations of 95% confidence intervals, but now for a smaller sample size. The confidence is now based on the t-distribution approximation. The color denotes if the interval fell on the parameter or not.",fig.height=8}
mypar()
plot(mean(chowPopulation) + c(-7,7), c(1,1), type="n",
     xlab="weight", ylab="interval", ylim=c(1,B))
abline(v=mean(chowPopulation))
##Q <- qnorm(1- 0.05/2) ##no longer normal so use:
Q <- qt(1- 0.05/2, df=4)
N <- 5
for (i in 1:B) {
  chow <- sample(chowPopulation, N)
  se <- sd(chow)/sqrt(N)
  interval <- c(mean(chow)-Q*se, mean(chow)+Q*se )
  covered <- mean(chowPopulation) <= interval[2] & mean(chowPopulation) >= interval[1]
  color <- ifelse(covered,1,2)
  lines(interval, c(i,i),col=color)
}
```

Now the intervals are made bigger. This is because the t-distribution has fatter tails and therefore:

```{r}
qt(1- 0.05/2, df=4)
```

is bigger than...

```{r}
qnorm(1- 0.05/2)
```

...which makes the intervals larger and hence cover $\mu_X$ more frequently; in fact, about 95% of the time.

#### Connection Between Confidence Intervals and p-values

We recommend that in practice confidence intervals be reported instead of p-values. If for some reason you are required to provide p-values, or required that your results are significant at the 0.05 of 0.01 levels, confidence intervals do provide this information. 

If we are talking about a t-test p-value, we are asking if 
differences as extreme as the one we observe, $\bar{Y} - \bar{X}$, are likely when the difference between the population averages is actually equal to
zero. So we can form a confidence interval with the observed 
difference. Instead of writing $\bar{Y} - \bar{X}$ repeatedly, let's
define this difference as a new variable 
$d \equiv \bar{Y} - \bar{X}$ . 

Suppose you use CLT and report $d \pm 2 s_d/\sqrt{N}$, with $s_d = \sqrt{s_X^2+s_Y^2}$, as a
95% confidence interval for the difference and this interval does not
include 0 (a false positive).
Because the interval does not include 0, this implies that either
$D - 2 s_d/\sqrt{N}  > 0$ or $d + 2 s_d/\sqrt{N} < 0$.
This suggests that either
$\sqrt{N}d/s_d > 2$ or $\sqrt{N}d/s_d < 2$.  This
then implies that the t-statistic is more extreme than 2, which in
turn suggests that the p-value must be smaller than 0.05
(approximately, for a more exact calculation use `qnorm(.05/2)` instead of 2).
The same calculation can be made if we use the t-distribution instead of
CLT (with `qt(.05/2, df=2*N-2)`).
In summary, if a 95% or 99% confidence interval does not include
0, then the p-value must be smaller than 0.05 or 0.01 respectively. 

Note that the confidence interval for the difference $d$ is provided by the `t.test` function:

```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(downloader)
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/master/inst/extdata/femaleMiceWeights.csv"
filename <- "femaleMiceWeights.csv"
if (!file.exists(filename)) download(url,destfile=filename)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
dat <- read.csv("femaleMiceWeights.csv")
controlIndex <- which(dat$Diet=="chow")
treatmentIndex <- which(dat$Diet=="hf")
control <- dat[controlIndex,2]
treatment <- dat[treatmentIndex,2]
```

```{r}
t.test(treatment,control)$conf.int
```

In this case, the 95% confidence interval does include 0 and we observe that the p-value is larger than 0.05 as predicted. If we change this to a 90% confidence interval, then:

```{r}
t.test(treatment,control,conf.level=0.9)$conf.int
```

0 is no longer in the confidence interval (which is expected because
the p-value is smaller than 0.10). 

## Power Calculations 

#### Introduction

We have used the example of the effects of two different diets on the weight of mice. Since in this illustrative example we have access to the population, we know that in fact there is a substantial (about 10%) difference between the average weights of the two populations:

```{r,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
library(downloader)
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/master/inst/extdata/mice_pheno.csv"
filename <- "mice_pheno.csv"
if(!file.exists(filename)) download(url,destfile=filename)
```

```{r,message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
dat <- read.csv("mice_pheno.csv") #Previously downloaded 

controlPopulation <- filter(dat,Sex == "F" & Diet == "chow") %>%  
  select(Bodyweight) %>% unlist

hfPopulation <- filter(dat,Sex == "F" & Diet == "hf") %>%  
  select(Bodyweight) %>% unlist

mu_hf <- mean(hfPopulation)
mu_control <- mean(controlPopulation)
print(mu_hf - mu_control)
print((mu_hf - mu_control)/mu_control * 100) #percent increase
```

We have also seen that, in some cases, when we take a sample and perform a t-test, we don't always get a p-value smaller than 0.05. For example, here is a case where we take a sample of 5 mice and don't achieve statistical significance at the 0.05 level:

```{r}
set.seed(1)
N <- 5
hf <- sample(hfPopulation,N)
control <- sample(controlPopulation,N)
t.test(hf,control)$p.value
```

Did we make a mistake? By not rejecting the null hypothesis, are we
saying the diet has no effect? The answer to this question is no. All
we can say is that we did not reject the null hypothesis. But this
does not necessarily imply that the null is true. The problem is that,
in this particular instance, we don't have enough _power_, a term we
are now going to define. If you are doing scientific research, it is
very likely that you will have to do a power calculation at some
point. In many cases, it is an ethical obligation as it can help you
avoid sacrificing mice unnecessarily or limiting the number of human
subjects exposed to potential risk in a study. Here we explain what
statistical power means. 

#### Types of Error

Whenever we perform a statistical test, we are aware that we may make a
mistake. This is why our p-values are not 0. Under the null, there is
always a positive, perhaps very small, but still positive chance that we
will reject the null when it is true. If the p-value is 0.05, it will
happen 1 out of 20 times. This *error* is called _type I error_ by
statisticians. 

A type I error is defined as rejecting the null when we should
not. This is also referred to as a false positive. So why do we then
use 0.05? Shouldn't we use 0.000001 to be really sure? The reason we
don't use infinitesimal cut-offs to avoid type I errors at all cost is
that there is another error we can commit: to not reject the null when we
should. This is called a _type II error_ or a false negative. The R
code analysis above shows an example of a false negative: we did not
reject the null hypothesis (at the 0.05 level) and, because we happen
to know and peeked at the true population means, we know there is in fact a
difference. Had we used a p-value cutoff of 0.25, we would not have
made this mistake. However, in general, are we comfortable with a type
I error rate of 1 in 4? Usually we are not.  


#### The 0.05 and 0.01 Cut-offs Are Arbitrary

Most journals and regulatory agencies frequently insist that results be significant at the 0.01 or 0.05 levels. Of course there is nothing special about these numbers other than the fact that some of the first papers on p-values used these values as examples. Part of the goal of this book is to give readers a good understanding of what p-values and confidence intervals are so that these choices can be judged in an informed way. Unfortunately, in science, these cut-offs are applied somewhat mindlessly, but that topic is part of a complicated debate.

#### Power Calculation

Power is the probability of rejecting the null when the null is
false. Of course "when the null is false" is a complicated statement
because it can be false in many ways.
$\Delta \equiv \mu_Y - \mu_X$
could be anything and the power actually depends on this parameter. It
also depends on the standard error of your estimates which in turn
depends on the sample size and the population standard deviations. In
practice, we don't know these so we usually report power for several
plausible values of $\Delta$, $\sigma_X$, $\sigma_Y$ and various
sample sizes.
Statistical theory gives us formulas to calculate
power. The `pwr` package performs these calculations for you. Here we
will illustrate the concepts behind power by coding up simulations in R. 

Suppose our sample size is: 

```{r}
N <- 12
```

and we will reject the null hypothesis at:

```{r}
alpha <- 0.05
```

What is our power with this particular data? We will compute this probability by re-running the exercise many times and calculating the proportion of times the null hypothesis is rejected. Specifically, we will run: 

```{r}
B <- 2000
```

simulations. The simulation is as follows: we take a sample of size $N$ from both control and treatment groups, we perform a t-test comparing these two, and report if the p-value is less than `alpha` or not. We write a function that does this:

```{r}
reject <- function(N, alpha=0.05){
   hf <- sample(hfPopulation,N) 
   control <- sample(controlPopulation,N)
   pval <- t.test(hf,control)$p.value
   pval < alpha
}
```

Here is an example of one simulation for a sample size of 12. The call to `reject` answers the question "Did we reject?" 
```{r}
reject(12)
```

Now we can use the `replicate` function to do this `B` times. 

```{r}
rejections <- replicate(B,reject(N))
```

Our power is just the proportion of times we correctly reject. So with  $N=12$ our power is only: 

```{r}
mean(rejections)
```

This explains why the t-test was not rejecting when we knew the null
was false. With a sample size of just 12, our power is about 23%. To
guard against false positives at the 0.05 level, we had set the
threshold at a high enough level that resulted in many type II
errors. 

Let's see how power improves with N. We will use the function `sapply`, which applies a function to each of the elements of a vector. We want to repeat the above for the following sample size:

```{r}
Ns <- seq(5, 50, 5)
```

So we use `apply` like this:
```{r}
power <- sapply(Ns,function(N){
  rejections <- replicate(B, reject(N))
  mean(rejections)
  })
```

For each of the three simulations, the above code returns the proportion of times we reject. Not surprisingly power increases with N:

```{r power_versus_sample_size, fig.cap="Power plotted against sample size."}
plot(Ns, power, type="b")
```

Similarly, if we change the level `alpha` at which we reject, power
changes. The smaller I want the chance of type I error to be, the less
power I will have. Another way of saying this is that we trade off
between the two types of error. We can see this by writing similar code, but
keeping $N$ fixed and considering several values of `alpha`:

```{r power_versus_alpha, fig.cap="Power plotted against cut-off."}
N <- 30
alphas <- c(0.1,0.05,0.01,0.001,0.0001)
power <- sapply(alphas,function(alpha){
  rejections <- replicate(B,reject(N,alpha=alpha))
  mean(rejections)
})
plot(alphas, power, xlab="alpha", type="b", log="x")
```

Note that the x-axis in this last plot is in the log scale.

There is no "right" power or "right" alpha level, but it is important that you understand what each means.

To see this clearly, you could create a plot with curves of power versus N. Show several curves in the same plot with color representing alpha level.

#### p-values Are Arbitrary under the Alternative Hypothesis

Another consequence of what we have learned about power is that
p-values are somewhat arbitrary when the 
null hypothesis is not true and therefore
the *alternative* hypothesis is true (the
difference between the population means is not zero).
When the alternative hypothesis is true, 
we can make a p-value as small as we want simply by increasing
the sample size (supposing that we have an infinite population to sample
from). We can show this property of p-values
by drawing larger and larger samples from our
population and calculating p-values. This works because, in our case,
we know that the alternative hypothesis is true, since we have
access to the populations and can calculate the difference in their means.

First write a function that returns a p-value for a given sample size $N$:

```{r}
calculatePvalue <- function(N) {
   hf <- sample(hfPopulation,N) 
   control <- sample(controlPopulation,N)
   t.test(hf,control)$p.value
}
```

We have a limit here of 200 for the high-fat diet population, but we can
see the effect well before we get to 200.
For each sample size, we will calculate a few p-values. We can do
this by repeating each value of $N$ a few times.

```{r}
Ns <- seq(10,200,by=10)
Ns_rep <- rep(Ns, each=10)
```

Again we use `sapply` to run our simulations:

```{r}
pvalues <- sapply(Ns_rep, calculatePvalue)
```

Now we can plot the 10 p-values we generated for each sample size:

```{r pvals_decrease, fig.cap="p-values from random samples at varying sample size. The actual value of the p-values decreases as we increase sample size whenever the alternative hypothesis is true."}
plot(Ns_rep, pvalues, log="y", xlab="sample size",
     ylab="p-values")
abline(h=c(.01, .05), col="red", lwd=2)
```

Note that the y-axis is log scale and that the p-values show a
decreasing trend all the way to $10^{-8}$
as the sample size gets larger. The standard cutoffs
of 0.01 and 0.05 are indicated with horizontal red lines.

It is important to remember that p-values are not more interesting as
they become very very small. Once we have convinced ourselves to
reject the null hypothesis at a threshold we find reasonable, having
an even smaller p-value just means that we sampled more mice than was
necessary.  Having a larger sample size does help to increase the
precision of our estimate of the difference $\Delta$, but the fact
that the p-value becomes very very small is just a natural consequence
of the mathematics of the test.  The p-values get smaller and smaller
with increasing sample size because the numerator of the t-statistic
has $\sqrt{N}$ (for equal sized groups, and a similar effect occurs
when $M \neq N$). Therefore, if $\Delta$ is non-zero, the t-statistic
will increase with $N$.

Therefore, a better statistic to report is the effect size with
a confidence interval or some statistic which gives the reader a
sense of the change in a meaningful scale. We can
report the effect size as a percent by dividing the difference
and the confidence interval by the control population mean:

```{r}
N <- 12
hf <- sample(hfPopulation, N)
control <- sample(controlPopulation, N)
diff <- mean(hf) - mean(control)
diff / mean(control) * 100
t.test(hf, control)$conf.int / mean(control) * 100
```

In addition, we can report a statistic called
[Cohen's d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size#Cohen.27s_d),
which is the difference between the groups divided by the pooled standard
deviation of the two groups. 

```{r}
sd_pool <- sqrt(((N-1)*var(hf) + (N-1)*var(control))/(2*N - 2))
diff / sd_pool
```

This tells us how many standard deviations of the data the mean of the
high-fat diet group is from the control group. Under the
alternative hypothesis, unlike the t-statistic which is guaranteed to
increase, the effect size and Cohen's d will become more precise.



```{r,include=FALSE}
set.seed(1)
```


## Monte Carlo Simulation

Computers can be used to generate pseudo-random numbers. For practical purposes these pseudo-random numbers can be used to imitate random variables from the real world. This permits us to examine properties of random variables using a computer instead of theoretical or analytical derivations. One very useful aspect of this concept is that we can create *simulated* data to test out ideas or competing methods, without actually having to perform laboratory experiments.

Simulations can also be used to check theoretical or analytical results. Also, many of the theoretical results we use in statistics are based on asymptotics: they hold when the sample size goes to infinity. In practice, we never have an infinite number of samples so we may want to know how well the theory works with our actual sample size. Sometimes we can answer this question analytically, but not always. Simulations are extremely useful in these cases.

As an example, let's use a Monte Carlo simulation to compare the CLT to the t-distribution approximation for different sample sizes.

```{r,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
library(rafalib)
library(downloader)
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/master/inst/extdata/mice_pheno.csv"
filename <- "mice_pheno.csv"
if (!file.exists(filename)) download(url,destfile=filename)
```

```{r,message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
dat <- read.csv("mice_pheno.csv")
controlPopulation <- filter(dat,Sex == "F" & Diet == "chow") %>%  
  select(Bodyweight) %>% unlist
```

We will build a function that automatically generates a t-statistic under the null hypothesis for a sample size of `n`.

```{r}
ttestgenerator <- function(n) {
  #note that here we have a false "high fat" group where we actually
  #sample from the chow or control population. 
  #This is because we are modeling the null.
  cases <- sample(controlPopulation,n)
  controls <- sample(controlPopulation,n)
  tstat <- (mean(cases)-mean(controls)) / 
      sqrt( var(cases)/n + var(controls)/n ) 
  return(tstat)
  }
ttests <- replicate(1000, ttestgenerator(10))
```

With 1,000 Monte Carlo simulated occurrences of this random variable, we can now get a glimpse of its distribution:

```{r ttest_hist, fig.cap="Histogram of 1000 Monte Carlo simulated t-statistics."}
hist(ttests)
```

So is the distribution of this t-statistic well approximated by the
normal distribution? In the next chapter, we will formally introduce
quantile-quantile plots, which provide a useful visual inspection of
how well one distribution approximates another. As we will explain
later, if points fall on the identity line, it means the approximation
is a good one. 

```{r ttest_qqplot, fig.cap="Quantile-quantile plot comparing 1000 Monte Carlo simulated t-statistics to theoretical normal distribution."}
qqnorm(ttests)
abline(0,1)
```

This looks like a very good approximation. For this particular population, a sample size of 10 was large enough to use the CLT approximation. How about 3? 

```{r, ttest_df3_qqplot,fig.cap="Quantile-quantile plot comparing 1000 Monte Carlo simulated t-statistics with three degrees of freedom to theoretical normal distribution."}
ttests <- replicate(1000, ttestgenerator(3))
qqnorm(ttests)
abline(0,1)
```

Now we see that the large quantiles, referred to by statisticians as
the _tails_, are larger than expected (below the line on the left side
of the plot and above the line on the right side of the plot).  In the
previous module, we explained that when the sample size is not large
enough and the *population values* follow a normal distribution, then
the t-distribution is a better approximation. Our simulation results
seem to confirm this:

```{r, ttest_v_tdist_qqplot,fig.cap="Quantile-quantile plot comparing 1000 Monte Carlo simulated t-statistics with three degrees of freedom to theoretical t-distribution."}
ps <- (seq(0,999)+0.5)/1000
qqplot(qt(ps,df=2*3-2),ttests,xlim=c(-6,6),ylim=c(-6,6))
abline(0,1)
```

The t-distribution is a much better approximation in this case, but it is still not perfect. This is due to the fact that the original data is not that well approximated by the normal distribution.

```{r, dat_qqplot, fig.cap="Quantile-quantile of original data compared to theoretical quantile distribution."}
qqnorm(controlPopulation)
qqline(controlPopulation)
```

## Parametric Simulations for the Observations

The technique we used to motivate random variables and the null
distribution was a type of Monte Carlo simulation. We had access to
population data and generated samples at random. In practice, we do
not have access to the entire population. The reason for using the
approach here was for educational purposes. However, when we want to
use Monte Carlo simulations in practice, it is much more typical to
assume a parametric distribution and generate a population from
this, which is called a _parametric simulation_. This means that we take
parameters estimated from the real data (here the mean and the standard
deviation), and plug these into a model (here the normal
distribution).  This is actually the most common form of Monte Carlo
simulation. 

For the case of weights, we could use our knowledge that mice typically weigh 24 grams with a SD of about 3.5 grams, and that the distribution is approximately normal, to generate population data:


```{r}
controls<- rnorm(5000, mean=24, sd=3.5) 
```

After we generate the data, we can then repeat the exercise above. We no longer have to use the `sample` function since we can re-generate random normal numbers. The `ttestgenerator` function therefore can be written as follows: 

```{r}
ttestgenerator <- function(n, mean=24, sd=3.5) {
  cases <- rnorm(n,mean,sd)
  controls <- rnorm(n,mean,sd)
  tstat <- (mean(cases)-mean(controls)) / 
      sqrt( var(cases)/n + var(controls)/n ) 
  return(tstat)
  }
```



```{r,include=FALSE}
set.seed(1)
```

## Permutation Tests

Suppose we have a situation in which none of the standard mathematical statistical approximations apply. We have computed a summary statistic, such as the difference in mean, but do not have a useful approximation, such as that provided by the CLT. In practice, we do not have access to all values in the population so we can't perform a simulation as done above. Permutation tests can be useful in these scenarios. 

We are back to the scenario where we only have 10 measurements for each group.

```{r,message=FALSE}
dat=read.csv("femaleMiceWeights.csv")

library(dplyr)

control <- filter(dat,Diet=="chow") %>% select(Bodyweight) %>% unlist
treatment <- filter(dat,Diet=="hf") %>% select(Bodyweight) %>% unlist
obsdiff <- mean(treatment)-mean(control)
```

In previous sections, we showed parametric approaches that helped determine if the observed difference was significant. Permutation tests take advantage of the fact that if we randomly shuffle the cases and control labels, then the null is true. So we shuffle the cases and control labels and assume that the ensuing distribution approximates the null distribution. Here is how we generate a null distribution by shuffling the data 1,000 times:

```{r diff_hist, fig.cap="Histogram of difference between averages from permutations. Vertical line shows the observed difference."}
N <- 12
avgdiff <- replicate(1000, {
    all <- sample(c(control,treatment))
    newcontrols <- all[1:N]
    newtreatments <- all[(N+1):(2*N)]
  return(mean(newtreatments) - mean(newcontrols))
})
hist(avgdiff)
abline(v=obsdiff, col="red", lwd=2)
```

How many of the null means are bigger than the observed value? That
proportion would be the p-value for the null. We add a 1 to the
numerator and denominator to account for misestimation of the p-value
(for more details see
[Phipson and Smyth, Permutation P-values should never be zero](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21044043)).

```{r}
#the proportion of permutations with larger difference
(sum(abs(avgdiff) > abs(obsdiff)) + 1) / (length(avgdiff) + 1)
```

Now let's repeat this experiment for a smaller dataset. We create a smaller dataset by sampling:

```{r}
N <- 5
control <- sample(control,N)
treatment <- sample(treatment,N)
obsdiff <- mean(treatment)- mean(control)
```
and repeat the exercise:


```{r diff_hist_N50, fig.cap="Histogram of difference between averages from permutations for smaller sample size. Vertical line shows the observed difference."}
avgdiff <- replicate(1000, {
    all <- sample(c(control,treatment))
    newcontrols <- all[1:N]
    newtreatments <- all[(N+1):(2*N)]
  return(mean(newtreatments) - mean(newcontrols))
})
hist(avgdiff)
abline(v=obsdiff, col="red", lwd=2)
```

Now the observed difference is not significant using this approach. Keep in mind that there is no theoretical guarantee that the null distribution estimated from permutations approximates the actual null distribution. For example, if there is a real difference between the populations, some of the permutations will be unbalanced and will contain some samples that explain this difference. This implies that the null distribution created with permutations will have larger tails than the actual null distribution. This is why permutations result in conservative p-values. For this reason, when we have few samples, we can't do permutations. 

Note also that permutation tests still have assumptions: samples are
assumed to be independent and "exchangeable". If there is hidden
structure in your data, then permutation tests can result in estimated
null distributions that underestimate the size of tails because the
permutations may destroy the existing structure in the original data. 



```{r,include=FALSE}
set.seed(1)
```

## Association Tests

The statistical tests we have covered up to now leave out a
substantial portion of life science projects. Specifically, we are
referring to data that is binary, categorical and ordinal. To give a
very specific example, consider genetic data where you have two groups
of genotypes (AA/Aa or aa) for cases and controls for a given
disease. The statistical question is if genotype and disease are
associated. As in the examples we have been studying previously, we have two
populations (AA/Aa and aa) and then numeric data for each, where disease
status can be coded as 0 or 1. So why can't we
perform a t-test? Note that the data is either 0 (control) or 1
(cases). It is pretty clear that this data is not normally distributed
so the t-distribution approximation is certainly out of the
question. We could use CLT if the sample size is large enough;
otherwise, we can use *association tests*. 

#### Lady Tasting Tea

One of the most famous examples of hypothesis testing was performed by
[R.A. Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher).
An acquaintance of Fisher's claimed that she could tell if milk was added
before or after tea was poured. Fisher gave her four pairs of
cups of tea: one with milk poured first, the other after. The order
was randomized. Say she picked 3 out of 4 correctly, do we believe
she has a special ability? Hypothesis testing helps answer this
question by quantifying what happens by chance. This example is called
the "Lady Tasting Tea" experiment (and, as it turns out, Fisher's friend
was a scientist herself, [Muriel Bristol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muriel_Bristol)).

The basic question we ask is: if the tester is actually guessing, what
are the chances that she gets 3 or more correct? Just as we have done
before, we can compute a probability under the null hypothesis that she
is guessing 4 of each. If we assume this null hypothesis, we can
think of this particular example as picking 4 balls out of an urn
with 4 green (correct answer) and 4 red (incorrect answer) balls.

Under the null hypothesis that she is simply guessing, each ball
has the same chance of being picked. We can then use combinatorics to
figure out each probability. The probability of picking 3 is
${4 \choose 3} {4 \choose 1} / {8 \choose 4} = 16/70$. The probability of
picking all 4 correct is
${4 \choose 4} {4 \choose 0}/{8 \choose 4}= 1/70$.
Thus, the chance of observing a 3 or something more extreme,
under the null hypothesis, is $\approx 0.24$. This is the p-value. The
procedure that produced this p-value is called _Fisher's exact test_ and
it uses the *hypergeometric distribution*. 

#### Two By Two Tables

The data from the experiment above can be summarized by a two by two table:

```{r}
tab <- matrix(c(3,1,1,3),2,2)
rownames(tab)<-c("Poured Before","Poured After")
colnames(tab)<-c("Guessed before","Guessed after")
tab
```

The function `fisher.test` performs the calculations above and can be obtained like this:

```{r}
fisher.test(tab,alternative="greater")
```

#### Chi-square Test

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become ubiquitous in
biology. One of the main statistical summaries used in these studies
are Manhattan plots. The y-axis of a Manhattan plot typically
represents the negative of log (base 10) of the p-values obtained for
association tests applied at millions of single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNP). The x-axis is typically organized by chromosome
(chromosome 1 to 22, X, Y, etc.).
These p-values are obtained in a similar way to
the test performed on the tea taster. However, in that example the
number of green and red balls is experimentally fixed and the number
of answers given for each category is also fixed. Another way to say
this is that the sum of the rows and the sum of the columns are
fixed. This defines constraints on the possible ways we can fill the two
by two table and also permits us to use the hypergeometric
distribution. In general, this is not the case. Nonetheless, there is
another approach, the Chi-squared test, which is described below. 

Imagine we have 250 individuals, where some of them have a given disease
and the rest do not. We observe that 20% of the individuals that are
homozygous for the minor allele (aa) have the disease compared to 10%
of the rest. Would we see this again if we picked another 250
individuals? 

Let's create a dataset with these percentages:

```{r}
disease=factor(c(rep(0,180),rep(1,20),rep(0,40),rep(1,10)),
               labels=c("control","cases"))
genotype=factor(c(rep("AA/Aa",200),rep("aa",50)),
                levels=c("AA/Aa","aa"))
dat <- data.frame(disease, genotype)
dat <- dat[sample(nrow(dat)),] #shuffle them up
head(dat)
```

To create the appropriate two by two table, we will use the function
`table`. This function tabulates the frequency of each level in a
factor. For example: 

```{r}
table(genotype)
table(disease)
```

If you provide the function with two factors, it will tabulate all possible pairs and thus create the two by two table:

```{r}
tab <- table(genotype,disease)
tab
```

Note that you can feed `table` $n$ factors and it will tabulate all $n$-tables.

The typical statistics we use to summarize these results is the odds ratio (OR). We compute the odds of having the disease if you are an "aa": 10/40, the odds of having the disease if you are an "AA/Aa": 20/180, and take the ratio: $(10/40) / (20/180)$ 

```{r}
(tab[2,2]/tab[2,1]) / (tab[1,2]/tab[1,1])
```

To compute a p-value, we don't use the OR directly. We instead assume
that there is no association between genotype and disease, and then
compute what we expect to see in each *cell* of the table (note: this use of
the word "cell" refers to elements in a matrix or table and has
nothing to do with biological cells). 
Under the null hypothesis,
the group with 200 individuals and the group with 50 individuals were
each randomly assigned the disease with the same probability. If this
is the case, then the probability of disease is: 

```{r}
p=mean(disease=="cases")
p
```

The expected table is therefore:

```{r}
expected <- rbind(c(1-p,p)*sum(genotype=="AA/Aa"),
                  c(1-p,p)*sum(genotype=="aa"))
dimnames(expected)<-dimnames(tab)
expected
```

The Chi-square test uses an asymptotic result (similar to the CLT)
related to the sums of independent binary outcomes. Using this
approximation, we can compute the probability of seeing a deviation
from the expected table as big as the one we saw. The p-value for this
table is:

```{r}
chisq.test(tab)$p.value
```

#### Large Samples, Small p-values

As mentioned earlier, reporting only p-values is not an appropriate
way to report the results of your experiment. Many genetic association
studies seem to overemphasize p-values. They have large sample sizes
and report impressively small p-values.  Yet when one looks closely at
the results, we realize odds ratios are quite modest: barely bigger
than 1. In this case the difference of having genotype AA/Aa or aa
might not change an individual's risk for a disease in an amount which is
*practically significant*, in that one might not change one's behavior
based on the small increase in risk.

There is not a one-to-one relationship between the odds ratio and the
p-value. To demonstrate, we recalculate the p-value keeping all the
proportions identical, but increasing the sample size by 10, which
reduces the p-value substantially (as we saw with the t-test under the
alternative hypothesis):

```{r}
tab<-tab*10
chisq.test(tab)$p.value
```

#### Confidence Intervals for the Odds Ratio

Computing confidence intervals for the OR is not mathematically straightforward. Unlike other statistics, for which we can derive useful approximations of their distributions, the OR is not only a ratio, but a ratio of ratios. Therefore, there is no simple way of using, for example, the CLT. 

  
One approach is to use the theory of *generalized linear models* which provides estimates of the log odds ratio, rather than the OR itself, that can be shown to be asymptotically normal. Here we provide R code without presenting the theoretical details (for further details please see a reference on generalized linear models such as [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model) or [McCullagh and Nelder, 1989](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=h9kFH2_FfBkC)): 

```{r}
fit <- glm(disease~genotype,family="binomial",data=dat)
coeftab<- summary(fit)$coef
coeftab
```

The second row of the table shown above gives you the estimate and SE of the log odds ratio. Mathematical theory tells us that this estimate is approximately normally distributed. We can therefore form a confidence interval and then exponentiate to provide a confidence interval for the OR.

```{r}
ci <- coeftab[2,1] + c(-2,2)*coeftab[2,2]
exp(ci)
```

The confidence includes 1, which is consistent with the p-value being bigger than 0.05. Note that the p-value shown here is based on a different approximation to the one used by the Chi-square test, which is why they differ.
